# TinyPngChecker

Tiny png checker works over [tinypng.com](http://www.tinypng.com) compressor, since TinyPng converter is not deterministic and does not provide a way to know if a file was already compressed, this gem provides some tools to workaround those issues

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tiny_png_checker'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tiny_png_checker

## Usage

  Three commands are available. All of them accept a --folders param as a comma separated string list being the folder paths to process:
        
    check    Checks recursively into specified folders for PNG files marked by TinyPngProcessor         
    compress Compress recursively PNGs inside specified folders using TinyPNG and mark files with TinyPngProcessor flag         
    help     Display global or [command] help documentation
    
  Example
  
    tiny_png_checker check --files ~/Documents,~/Images     

  There are some global options:
        
    -h, --help 
        Display help documentation
        
    -v, --version 
        Display version information
        
    -t, --trace 
        Display backtrace when an error occurs
